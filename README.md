# Overpy: Reaper rework

Workshop code: 2JSYD

## Life steal

Life steal is dumb and makes Reaper a too low skilled hero, and way too hard to duel. In this rework, life steal has been removed and instead Wraith is used to heal. 

## Wraith resource

Wraith now has a resource attached to it. When you use Wraith your resource will deplete and you will be kicked out of it when the resource is empty. Wraith has a small cooldown every time you use it, so it should not be too OP. 

## Wraith heal

Life steal has been replaced by a heal provided when using Wraith. This way Reaper players have to pay attention to the cooldowns he has instead of just ye olde run & gun.

## Leap

Shadow step has been replaced by the ability to leap, a bit like Winston. Together with the new Wraith, this will force Reaper to pick his battles more carefully, and to actually use his abilities as a means to engage and escape.
